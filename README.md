## 🧠 Concepts Used

### 🎯 HTML Concepts
- Semantic structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`)
- Linking external CSS and icon libraries  
- Use of forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`)
- Tables with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and alternating rows  
- Embedding Google Maps using `<iframe>`  
- Inserting and styling images (`<img>`)  
- Navigation using internal anchor links (`href="#section"`)  
- Accessibility tags like `alt` and `required` attributes  

### 🎨 CSS Concepts
- **CSS Grid Layout** → Used for the overall 2-column structure  
- **Flexbox** → For aligning content inside cards, headers, and navigation  
- **Sticky Positioning** → Sidebar remains fixed while scrolling

- **Typography Styling** → Custom font, weight, and alignment  
- **Hover Effects** → Visual feedback on cards, links, and buttons  
- **Scrollbar Customization** → Controlled scrolling for the schedule section  
- **Color Gradients** → Used in card hover background transitions  
- **Responsive Design Adjustments** → Using percentages and flexible sizing  
- **Shadows and Depth** → Added via `box-shadow` for modern UI appearance
